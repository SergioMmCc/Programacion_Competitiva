# About Us
We are Sergio Moncada and Diego Rangel, Systems Engineering students at `Universidad Tecnologica de Pereira UTP`. We are part of the competitive programming team `UTP - CodeDeGrace`.

We began our journey in competitive programming in the 2023 - II semester. Our goal is to qualify for future `ICPC programming world finals` in the years 2025 and 2026.
